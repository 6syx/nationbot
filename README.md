# nationbot

A (much simpler) bot to suit your ro-nation's needs. Takes little time to set up.

**THIS DOES REQUIRE NODE.JS IF YOU ARE RUNNING IT ON YOUR MAIN COMPUTER! https://nodejs.org/en/**

The main file that will be used in this guide will be the `config.json`. I am not responsible for any ratelimiting issues within this bot, and these may be fixed by changing the delay field in the immigration settings.

If you need any further assistance, contact [leo.#9999](https://discord.com/users/309803507249315852) ([309803507249315852](https://discord.com/users/309803507249315852)) on discord or open an issue.

## Setup

Most of the setup options are spoken about in the config itself, but the rest are self-explanatory.

## Getting roleset IDs

Install the extension [BTRoblox](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/btroblox-making-roblox-be/hbkpclpemjeibhioopcebchdmohaieln). If you right-click a rank, you will be able to copy its ID, as show below.

## Hosting

You are able to host this bot on your own computer, however it is not recommended as you would have to leave your computer open all the time. I suggest a form of cloud hosting, and a free and easy way is none other than repl.it.

[![Run on Replit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BinBashBanana/deploy-buttons/master/buttons/remade/replit.svg)](https://replit.com/github/paraanoia/nationbot)

If you click this button, it will create a version of nation bot in repl. Configure the config as you'd like and then run it. It will open a link in the top right.
Head to [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com) and make an account if you don't have one. Put your bot in as an HTTP monitor set to check every 5 minutes.
